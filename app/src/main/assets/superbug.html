<p>It used to be that if you got an infection, you could pop an antibiotic pill and rest assured that it could help you fend off your bacterial attacker. But those old tried-and-true pills may not be as effective as they once were, thanks to a rising number of new types of bacteria often referred to as superbugs.</p>

<p>"'Superbug' is essentially a slang term developed by the press that refers to highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria that can cause human infections," says Dr. David Hooper, an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.</p>

<p>Bacteria are wily creatures that mutate or acquire new genes in ways that allow them to outsmart the antibiotics that were once able to kill them. This mutation or gene acquisition process is what creates a superbug, and it's anything but super for all of us. Once bacteria undergo this transformation, there are fewer medicines — if any — that can cure the infection. Infections with superbugs are becoming increasingly common, affecting at least two million Americans every year and proving fatal in 23,000 cases, according to the CDC.</p>

<h2>Understanding superbugs</h2>

<p>But, while those numbers sound scary, most people are still pretty unlikely to encounter a superbug. "For the most part, these are not bugs that we would encounter on the street," says Dr. Hooper. Most people who contract an infection caused by a superbug catch it in a hospital. "Very often these are people who have multiple medical problems and interactions with the health care system, and who may have needed lots of antibiotics in the past," he says.</p>

<p>The supervillains of the superbug world that are most concerning to health experts today are bacteria known as gram-negative bacteria. Scientists classify bacteria as gram-positive or gram-negative based on the type of outer shell — known as the cell envelope — that they have. The gram-negative group includes some fairly nasty members that have developed resistance to one or more antibiotics, such as <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, which can cause everything from bloodstream and wound infections to pneumonia.</p>

<h2>Protecting yourself against superbugs</h2>

<p>So how can you protect yourself against superbugs? Here are some strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Practice good hygiene.</strong> While you're pretty unlikely to encounter a superbug in your daily life, good habits can help you protect yourself from even the slim risk. "Follow the rules that your mother taught you," says Dr. Hooper. Keep your surroundings clean, and wash your hands frequently.</p>

<p><strong>Understand food safety.</strong> In some cases, people are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria from the food they eat. According to the CDC, two common culprits, <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Campylobacter</em>, cause some 400,000 antibiotic-resistant infections in Americans every year. While you hope the food you buy has been handled properly, you can reduce your risk by washing fresh fruits and vegetables, and thoroughly cooking meat, poultry, and fish.</p>

<p><strong>Ask questions.</strong> If you do need to be admitted to the hospital for treatment, be alert to make sure hospital staff members are following good hygiene practices. "It's perfectly appropriate to ask health care providers about what is being done to prevent transmission of infections in the hospital," says Dr. Hooper. When clinicians or aides come into your room to treat you, make sure they have washed their hands. "We encourage patients to speak up about that as well," says Dr. Hooper.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid antibiotic overuse.</strong> "If you are prescribed an antibiotic, it's not unreasonable to ask the clinician ordering the antibiotic if it's truly necessary," says Dr. Hooper. Taking an antibiotic may well be necessary, but it's always wise to explore other options. Asking questions lets the provider know you are aware and interested. It also allows you to understand why your doctor thinks the antibiotic is needed.</p>

<p>Remember, antibiotics can't treat viruses, only bacterial infections. This means they won't help you get over the sniffling misery of the common cold or get you through a bout of the flu any faster. While there are medications for some viruses, most viral infections will resolve just as quickly without specific treatments.</p>

<p>In case of viral infections, focus on treatments that will help to relieve your symptoms, such as decongestants, nasal mists, or throat lozenges, until the virus runs its course.</p>
